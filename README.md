# Dotfiles

This is just a standard dotfiles repo

my nvim config is already in another repo, so I will not include it here.

The only part I recommend looking into is the bashrc file,
I have implemented a nice way to use fzf and jump into directories with ease.

## Needed dependencies (for fzf_cd)

- bat
- fzf
- fd
- perl
- grep
- sed
